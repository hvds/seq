Let f(n) represent the cardinality of the largest non-averaging subset
of { 1 .. n }, then the main table below shows 'n (i t): s' where i is
the number of iterations required, t is the time taken, and s is either
the lexically first example of a maximal non-averaging subset, or "no
improvement" if f(n) = f(n-1).

The pruning power table shows i^{1/n} at selected n.

pruning power:
