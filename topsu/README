Topological classification of sudoku unknowns.

Consider a partially-completed sudoku puzzle, showing just the "1"s:

1.. ... ...
... 1.. ...
... ... 1..

.1. ... ...
... .1. ...
... ... .oo

..1 ... ...
... ..1 ...
... ... .oo

The "o"s mark the positions that might still have a "1" placed in them.
This is the simplest case: there are 4 possible positions, and we must
choose 2 of them in which to place a "1", so there are 2 positions still
to be ruled out to complete the puzzle. I will call the number of
positions still to rule out the "weight" w.

The classic sudoku puzzle consists of a 9 x 9 grid consisting of 3 x 3
square regions (forming 3 "bands" of 3 rows each and 3 "stacks" of
3 columns) each of 3 x 3 positions. With an appropriate selection
of symbols it can easily be extended to a k^2 x k^2 grid, and for
the discussion below we assume k finite but arbitrarily large. (k <= w
will always be sufficient.)

We can model the set of unknowns as a 3-dimensional incidence matrix
in which each square is represented as a different height, and any
irrelevant rows, columns and layers are elided. A valid solution for
that matrix is then a subset in which every row, every column and
every layer has exactly one non-zero value.

(Note that within that matrix each layer must correspond to a region
forming the intersection of a band and a stack, each of which may be
partly elided.)

Using letters to represent height the matrix for the above case can
be represented as:

aa
bb

The question is: given a weight w, what is a(w), the number of sets of
positions with that weight that are a) topologically distinct, b) valid
and c) connected?

Topologically distinct: I think it is sufficient to define two sets as
distinct if one cannot be mapped on to the other by translation,
rotation, reflection; permutation of rows within a band or permutation
of bands (resp. columns/stacks); permutation of layers (or relabelling
of heights). I'm not entirely sure if that covers every type of mapping
that I would want to permit.

In particular, these two sets are distinct:

abb.  abb.
ab..  ab..
.ccd  .ccd
.c.d  ..cd

Valid: a valid set as one in which each position can be part of a
solution: any position that cannot be part of any solution must have
been removed, so a position like the below is invalid since the
bottom-right 'd' cannot be part of any solution.

.a.b
a.b.
.c.d
c.dd

Connected: a matrix is disconnected if we can divide the layers into two
non-empty subsets such that the rows and columns with non-zero values
in each subset are disjoint. (We can easily combine results for connected
sets to get equivalent counts without that restriction when desired.)

Here are the first few values of a(w), calculated manually:

a(1) = 0
a(2) = 1
a(3) = 2:

aa.  aa.
b.b  b.c
.cc  .bc

a(4) = 6:

aab  aaa
a.b  bb.
cc.  c.c

aa..  aa..  aa..  a.b.
b.b.  b.c.  b.b.  .a.b
.c.c  .b.c  .c.d  c.d.
..dd  ..dd  ..cd  .c.d

a(5) = 13:

aab  aaa
aab  bbb
cc.  cc.

aab.  aab.  aa.b  aaa.  aaa.
a.b.  a..c  ..ab  bb..  bb..
c..d  ..bc  c.c.  c..d  c..c
.c.d  dd..  .dd.  ..cd  ..dd

aa...  aa...  aa...  aa...  aa...  aa...
b.c..  b.b..  b.c..  b..c.  b.b..  b.b..
.b.c.  .c.d.  .b.d.  ..b.c  .c.c.  .c.c.
..d.e  ..c.d  ..c.d  .d.e.  ..d.e  ..d.d
...de  ...ee  ...ee  ..d.e  ...de  ...ee
