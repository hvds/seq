Let f(n) represent the cardinality of the largest non-averaging subset
of { 1 .. n }, then the main table below shows 'n (i t): s' where i is
the number of iterations required, t is the time taken, and s is either
the lexically first example of a maximal non-averaging subset, or "no
improvement" if f(n) = f(n-1).

The pruning power table shows i^{1/n} at selected n.

pruning power:
[ 55    101   130   143
  1.525                     (first pass)
  1.487                     (fix s_1 = 1)
  1.214 1.203               (prune using f() values)
  1.214 1.203 1.214         (reimplement in C)
  1.195 1.189 1.204 1.225   (n must not be blocked)
