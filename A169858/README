This directory includes C source code to calculate the sequences:
  A169858(n): the least value m such that all integers from 1..n divide
some prefix of m (written in base 10)
  A175516(n): the least even value m such that all integers from 1..n divide
some prefix of m (written in base 10)

See also:
  A177834(n): the least value m such that all integers from 1..n divide
some substring of m (written in base 10) [not implemented]

It requires the GNU GMP library, v5.0.0 or later: see <http://gmplib.org/>.

It should be fairly portable: if you have problems compiling it, please let
me know at <hv@crypt.org>. The most likely source of problems is the code
to show timings: you can define 'NO_TIMING' to avoid compiling this code,
in which case it will just show all timings as zero.

Makefile targets are "A169858" and "A175516".
